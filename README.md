# Time-Tracker-Extension


Simple Time Tracker is a Chrome extension that monitors and records how long you actively spend on user‐defined websites, displaying live usage stats and optional time‐limit alerts in a clean popup dashboard. Configure your tracked domains and limits in a single config.js file to customize which sites you want to watch.
